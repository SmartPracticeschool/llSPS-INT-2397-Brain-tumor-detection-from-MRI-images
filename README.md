Brain tumor detection from MRI images

Brain tumor identification is really challenging task in the early stages of life. But now it became advanced with various machine learning algorithms. Now a day’s issue of brain tumor automatic identification is of great interest. A tumor is the unusual growth of the tissues. A brain tumor is a number of unnecessary cells growing in the brain or central spine canal.
It is the unrestrained progress of cancer cells in any portion of the body. In Order to detect the brain tumor of a patient, we consider the data of patients like MRI images of a patient’s brain. Here our problem is to identify whether the tumor is present in the patient's brain or not. It is very important to detect the tumors at the starting level for a healthy life of a patient.
